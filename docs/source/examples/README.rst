Lightcurve Visualization Examples
==================================

This gallery demonstrates the capabilities of the ``hypothesis_lightcurves`` package
through interactive visualizations and code examples.

The examples are organized into the following categories:

- **Basic Lightcurves**: Fundamental lightcurve generation and visualization
- **Periodic Signals**: Sinusoidal patterns and period detection
- **Transient Events**: Supernova-like rise and decay profiles
- **Transformations**: Data processing operations like binning and resampling
- **Ensemble Statistics**: Statistical analysis across multiple generated lightcurves

Each example includes complete, runnable code that you can use as a starting point
for your own lightcurve analysis and testing workflows.
